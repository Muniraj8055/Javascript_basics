var - Global scoped or function scoped. The scope of the var keyword is the global or function scope.

let - block scoped: The scope of a let variable is only block scoped. It canâ€™t be accessible outside the 
particular block ({block}) 

const - this declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either global or local to the block in which it is
 declared

variable hoisting

Hoisting is Javascript default behaviour of moving declaration to the top of the function, if defined in a function or
the top of the global context if outside the function

var a; -> variable declaration
a = 10 -> variable initialization

we write like this                        compile phase

 var a = 10                                var a;
 document.write(a)                         var b;
 var b = 20                                a = 10;
                                           document.write(a);
                                           b = 20

a variable can be used before it has been declared

we write like this                        compile phase

 a = 10                                    var a;
 document.write(a)                         a = 10;
 var a                                     document.write(a);
